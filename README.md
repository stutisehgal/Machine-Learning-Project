# HANDWRITTEN DIGIT RECOGNITION (SVM + OpenCV)

The famous MNIST CSV dataset was used to train the handwriting recognition SVM classification model in the SVM MNIST digit recog file. 
Rbf kernel with gamma and C hyperparameter tuning was used to achieve optimum accuracy of 97% in classifying MNIST training dataset.
The model predictions were then made using the testing MNIST dataset CSV file.
Validation of model can be performed using user handwritten digit image which can be captured, preprocessed and given to the SVM MNIST model using handwritten image webcam-opencv-mnist file.

The famous load_digits available in sklearn datasets module was also used to train the handwriting recognition SVM classification model in the SVM Handwritten digit recog load_digits file. 
Rbf kernel with gamma and C hyperparameter tuning was used to achieve optimum accuracy of 97% in classifying load_digits dataset.
The model predictions were then made using the testing dataset file.

# Motivation
Handwritten digit recognition is an important benchmark task in computer vision. Handwritten character recognition is one of the practically important issues in pattern recognition applications. The applications of digit recognition includes in postal mail sorting, bank check processing, form data entry, etc.
