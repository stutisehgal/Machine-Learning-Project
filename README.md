# Machine-Learning-Project
Posting about my Machine Learning Projects:
The famous MNIST CSV dataset was used to train the handwriting recognition SVM classification model in the SVM MNIST digit recog file. 
Rbf kernel with gamma and C hyperparameter tuning was used to achieve optimum accuracy of 97% in classifying MNIST training dataset.
The model predictions were then made using the testing MNIST dataset CSV file.
Validation of model can be performed using user handwritten digit image which can be captured, preprocessed and given to the SVM MNIST model using handwritten image webcam-opencv-mnist file.

The famous load_digits available in sklearn datasets module was used to train the handwriting recognition SVM classification model in the SVM Handwritten digit recog load_digits file. 
Rbf kernel with gamma and C hyperparameter tuning was used to achieve optimum accuracy of 97% in classifying load_digits dataset.
The model predictions were then made using the testing dataset file.
Validation of model can be performed using user handwritten digit image which can be captured, preprocessed and given to the SVM Handwritten digit recog model using handwritten image webcam-opencv-digits file.
